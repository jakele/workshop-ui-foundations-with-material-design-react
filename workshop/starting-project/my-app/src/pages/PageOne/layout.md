## Hands-on Portion: Creating a Simple Layout Page and Adding Content

### Step 1: Introduction to the Starter Template

We are starting with Material-UI and all the necessary dependencies already installed for this activity. The starter template provided includes a few layout components to get you started. Let's take a closer look at these components and understand how to use and learn more about them:

1. Open the `PageOne.tsx` file in your code editor. This file contains the starter template for our layout page.
2. The template may appear complex at first, but let's dive into the details of each component to gain a better understanding of their usage.

#### Container

We begin with the [Container component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-container/). Take note of the API for the container and how passing different size variables can change its behavior. Refer to the [API documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/container/) for more information. Notice that we are using predefined container sizes, which are established ahead of development and can be considered immutable.

#### Grid

Next, let's explore the [Grid component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/). Again, notice that we are leveraging existing spacing variables rather than setting specific values. Take the time to read through the [API documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/grid/) and observe how the component's API allows for more sophisticated usage. Pay attention to sections like [Responsive values](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/grid/), which links to the Material Design documentation.

#### Paper

We are utilizing the [Paper component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-paper/) for its simplicity. Feel free to read more about it if you'd like.

#### Typography

Now, let's explore the humble [Typography component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/). Here, we move beyond using spacing variables and delve into more complex functionality. We can apply font styles, families, sizes, colors, and more through the [API documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/typography/).

It's important to note that although the Typography component may appear simple on the surface, it is quite extensive in its implementation. You can examine the source code to understand the underlying complexity:

- [Component source code](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/master/packages/mui-material/src/Typography/Typography.js)
- [System source code](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/master/packages/mui-system/src/typography.js)
- [Styles source code](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/a56b6032aae01675abb22cbbc00eb11960671fa9/packages/mui-material/src/styles/createTypography.js#L10)
- [Create theme source code](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/a56b6032aae01675abb22cbbc00eb11960671fa9/packages/mui-system/src/createTheme/createTheme.test.js#L37)

This demonstrates the amount of effort that goes into creating a robust UI component. Even something as seemingly simple as styled typography involves hundreds of lines of code, not to mention tests, typings, custom branding, and more.

### Step 2: Build with What We Learned

Now, let's start building! Take what we've learned and use it to create a site that matches the `example.png` image in this directory.

### Step 3: Make It Responsive

Once the layout is complete, we'll make it responsive by updating the breakpoints in our opening Grid component:

```jsx
<Grid item md={12}>
```
