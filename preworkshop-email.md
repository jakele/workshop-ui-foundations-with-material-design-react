Subject: Preparing for our UI Foundations with Google Material Design 2.0 and React MUI Workshop

Hello Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for our upcoming UI Foundations Workshop, I wanted to share a few details to help you prepare and make the most of our time together.

In this workshop, we're going to delve deeper into UI creation, focusing on Google's Material Design 2.0 and React MUI. We'll explore how these tools can provide us with a strong, unopinionated foundation for our applications, allowing us to layer in brand complexities while still offering consistent and intuitive user experiences.

To make the most out of our session, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the basics of Google's Material Design and React. If you have not yet done so, please ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. A general understanding of the principles of UI/UX design would also be beneficial.

Our goal is to make this session interactive and rewarding. Therefore, your engagement, preparation, and input are incredibly important. I encourage you to ask questions, share thoughts, and actively participate in the discussions.

Looking forward to our shared learning experience!

Cheers,
Jeffrey
