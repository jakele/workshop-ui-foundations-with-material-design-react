**Subject:** Thank You for Attending the UI Foundations Workshop

Hello Team,

Thank you for your active participation in our UI Foundations with Google Material Design 2.0 and React MUI Workshop. Your enthusiasm and willingness to engage contributed greatly to our shared learning experience.

During the workshop, we explored the foundational principles of Google's Material Design 2.0 and React MUI, delved into Angular Material, and discussed the importance of consistency in user interactions. We also looked at a 'Norman Door' as an analogy for ineffective UI designs and stressed the importance of intuitive interfaces. I hope these discussions provided you with a deeper understanding of UI/UX design and its relevance in creating user-friendly applications.

### FAQs

1. **Where can I learn more about Material Design 2.0?**
   Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/design) website is a great starting point. It covers all the design principles and guidelines, providing a comprehensive view of the design language.

2. **Where can I find more information about React MUI?**
   The [React MUI Documentation](https://mui.com/) provides a detailed guide on how to use React MUI, including its various components and customization options.

3. **What is a 'Norman Door' and why is it relevant to UI/UX design?**
   A 'Norman Door' is a door where the design tells you to do the opposite of what you're actually supposed to do. For example, a door with a handle that looks like it should be pulled, but it actually needs to be pushed. It's a symbol of bad design - when the design confuses the user rather than helping them. In UI/UX, we strive to avoid creating 'Norman Doors' by making our interfaces intuitive and easy to use. Here is a [podcast episode](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/norman-doors-dont-know-whether-push-pull/) from 99% Invisible that covers the concept in depth.
